<h2>Coding Assistance</h2>
<p>You will find an instance of code assistance in my Javascript file, I could not figure out how to get the markers to show up as circles instead of the default marker so I had to find some help on the internet. The URL is included here as well as commented out in the code in the relevant place.</p>
